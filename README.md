## Capitalism
A JavaScript bot written with the discord.js API wrapper.

### What is discord.js?
discord.js is a node.js module for creating applications with Discord integrations. This lib enables you to also write Discord bots, which can carry out different tasks and respond to messages in different ways.

### Why JavaScript?
Javascript is a nice and easy high level programming language that is great for beginners or young uns like me. I am thirteen and JavaScript is a nice place to start. I have written programs in C, C++, C#, Java, Assembly, and a range of other low level programming languages, but high level languages like Python and JavaScript are nice and easy to write in.

### What is the bot for?
Sometimes, when I'm bored, I decide to just write a program in a language that I haven't really used. So, the bot isn't a major project or anything, just something I can maybe work on sometimes. But, the bot has an economic system in which you get paid, and you can spend your money on stuff that I made up. The currency is USD but you obviously don't get paid real USD, just a virtual one that I made with JSON.

### How do I use him?
To use a bot, it has to be in one of your discord servers. If you don't have Discord, then you can download it at https://www.discordapp.com/. Discord supports quite a few operating systems such as Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and quite a few Linux distros. At the moment the bot isn't ready for use in public servers, but he will be soon.
